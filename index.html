            Hey Ms. Poonam Kawle,<br>

            Ever since I first met you on July 2nd, I could have never imagined meeting someone as special as you. I still vividly remember that day when I texted you for the first time, not knowing that you would come to mean so much to meâ€”just like my own family. From the start, youâ€™ve been the most kind-hearted person, and I honestly believe you're the nicest person Iâ€™ve ever met. Your cuteness just adds to how amazing you are.
            <br>
            Even though Iâ€™m here in Mumbai and you're in Nagpur (gaon ðŸ˜‰), it feels like weâ€™re sitting right next to each other when we text. Iâ€™m genuinely so happy to have you in my life. Every time we talk on the phone, my heart races faster than you can imagine. Yes, Iâ€™m shy, I agreeâ€”but I think thereâ€™s a lot of fun in that too. Your voice is like a soothing melody, and every conversation with you leaves me feeling relaxed and stress-free.
            <br>
            I love you, cutu. ðŸ’–<br>
            Yours lovingly,<br>
                 -<b><i>Omkar</i></b>
